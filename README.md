# Seven Domains of a Typical IT Infrastructure

---

## Objective
The objective of this lab is to explore and understand the seven domains of a typical IT infrastructure, including the workstation, LAN, LAN-to-WAN, WAN, remote access, and system/application domains. This involves using common command-line utilities, remote connections, and network devices to gather relevant system information and identify common server roles and network devices. Additionally, the lab aims to provide hands-on experience in applying security controls and measures to protect the IT infrastructure, as well as conducting independent, unguided work to address real-world security challenges and threats.

## Skills Learned

- **IT Infrastructure Domains**: Gained a comprehensive understanding of the seven domains of a typical IT infrastructure.
- **Security Controls**: Reviewed and applied basic security controls on Windows workstations.
- **Network Devices**: Explored devices within the LAN segment, understanding their roles and configurations.
- **pfSense Application**: Learned key functionalities of pfSense, including routing, Network Address Translation (NAT), and packet filtering.
- **Server Roles**: Examined common server roles such as Domain Controller, DNS Server, and Web Server, gaining insights into their importance in IT infrastructures.
- **Command-Line Utilities**: Utilized various command-line tools to manage and configure systems.
- **Remote Connections**: Used PuTTY for establishing remote connections to network devices and servers.
- **Documentation**: Created documentation using screen captures to record lab results and configurations.

## Tools Used

The following software and utilities were used to explore and analyze various aspects of a typical IT infrastructure:

- **PuTTY**: For remote connections to network devices and servers.
- **Ping**: To test network connectivity between devices.
- **Open vSwitch**: Virtual network switch for creating and managing virtualized network environments.
- **TrueNAS**: Network-attached storage solution for managing storage systems.
- **pfSense**: Open-source firewall/router for routing, Network Address Translation (NAT), and packet filtering.
- **Traceroute**: Utility to trace the path packets take across a network and identify network hops.
- **Nslookup**: DNS query tool to gather domain name and IP address information.
- **OpenVPN**: VPN solution to establish secure remote connections.
- **OWASP Juice Shop**: Vulnerable web application used for security testing and training.

These tools were utilized to gather relevant system information, remotely connect to network devices, and identify common network devices and server roles.
